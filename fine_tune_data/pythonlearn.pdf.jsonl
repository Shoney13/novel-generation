Other high-level\nlanguages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not under-\nstand any of these high-level languages. The CPU understands a language we call machine language . Machine language is\nvery simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all i n zeros\nand ones:\n001010001110100100101010000001111\n11100110000011101010010101101101\n... Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros\nand ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Pytho n. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various\ntranslators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like P ython or\nJavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language fo r\nactual execution by the CPU. Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not\nportable across di\ufb00erent types of hardware. Programs written in high-level lan-\nguages can be moved between di\ufb00erent computers by using a di\ufb00erent interpreter\non the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version\nof the program for the new machine. These programming language translators fall into two general categories: (1) inter-\npreters and (2) compilers.

Other high-level\nlanguages include Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic, Perl, JavaScript, and many more. The actual hardware inside the Central Processing Unit (CPU) does not under-\nstand any of these high-level languages. The CPU understands a language we call machine language . Machine language is\nvery simple and frankly very tiresome to write because it is represented all i n zeros\nand ones:\n001010001110100100101010000001111\n11100110000011101010010101101101\n... Machine language seems quite simple on the surface, given that there are only zeros\nand ones, but its syntax is even more complex and far more intricate than Pytho n. So very few programmers ever write machine language. Instead we build various\ntranslators to allow programmers to write in high-level languages like P ython or\nJavaScript and these translators convert the programs to machine language fo r\nactual execution by the CPU. Since machine language is tied to the computer hardware, machine language is not\nportable across di\ufb00erent types of hardware. Programs written in high-level lan-\nguages can be moved between di\ufb00erent computers by using a di\ufb00erent interpreter\non the new machine or recompiling the code to create a machine language version\nof the program for the new machine.

When we want to write a program, we use a text editor to write the Python\ninstructions into a \ufb01le, which is called a script . By convention, Python scripts\nhave names that end with .py. To execute the script, you have to tell the Python interpreter the name of the \ufb01le.
